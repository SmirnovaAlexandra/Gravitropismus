  abstract      = {Unicellular tip-growing cells are excellent experimental systems in which to study gravitropism because cell extension, gravity sensing and the gravity response are all confined to the apical dome. Thus various approaches can be used to determine the distinct steps of the short gravitropic signal-transduction chain, which lacks a signal-transmission phase between the gravity-sensing cells and the competent responding target cells. Single-cell systems readily allow in-vivo observation of cellular processes during gravistimulation at 1?g, centrifugation, clinostatting and in microgravity, as well as permitting fluorescence labeling. Such diverse studies have revealed fascinating information on the mechanism of gravitropic tip growth, especially on the important role of the cytoskeleton in the positioning of the statoliths and in organizing and adjusting the Spitzenk{\"o}rper. A hypothesis explaining the negative and positive gravitropism of Chara rhizoids and Chara protonemata has been put forward, which emphasizes the role of the actin cytoskeleton in the process of gravitropic tip-growth. Differences in the gravitropic responses of single-cell systems, however, reflect a diversity of gravitropic mechanisms, and represent an example of parallel evolution.},

  abstract     = {Gravitropism, the slow reorientation of plant growth in response to gravity, is a key determinant of the form and posture of land plants. Shoot gravitropism is triggered when statocysts sense the local angle of the growing organ relative to the gravitational field. Lateral transport of the hormone auxin to the lower side is then enhanced, resulting in differential gene expression and cell elongation causing the organ to bend. However, little is known about the dynamics, regulation, and diversity of the entire bending and straightening process. Here, we modeled the bending and straightening of a rod-like organ and compared it with the gravitropism kinematics of different organs from 11 angiosperms. We show that gravitropic straightening shares common traits across species, organs, and orders of magnitude. The minimal dynamic model accounting for these traits is not the widely cited gravisensing law but one that also takes into account the sensing of local curvature, what we describe here as a graviproprioceptive law. In our model, the entire dynamics of the bending/straightening response is described by a single dimensionless “bending number” B that reflects the ratio between graviceptive and proprioceptive sensitivities. The parameter B defines both the final shape of the organ at equilibrium and the timing of curving and straightening. B can be estimated from simple experiments, and the model can then explain most of the diversity observed in experiments. Proprioceptive sensing is thus as important as gravisensing in gravitropic control, and the B ratio can be measured as phenotype in genetic studies.},
